                                    <li>b.	You must not license, sell, lease, rent, lend, convey or otherwise transfer or assign the Data.</li>

                                    <li>d.	You must ensure that your app does not replicate a substantial number of features and/or the overall experience of GO Transit, and must ensure that the visual design of your app is not confusingly similar to the design or look and feel of any part of the GO Transit platform, including without limitation, the GO Transit website and/or any GO Transit mobile app.</li>

Metrolinx will try to ensure, as far as possible, that future version(s) of the GO Transit API are backwards compatible with at least the most recent previous version, but cannot guarantee that this will always be possible.</li>
                            <li>9.	<b>Disclaimer.</b> The Data is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. You acknowledge that the Data provided may not be cleansed, complete or reconciled to ensure its accuracy and that any use, reproduction or redistribution of the Data shall be at your own risk.

                            <li>10.	<b>Limitation of Liability.</b>Under no circumstances shall Metrolinx or its directors, officers, employees or agents be liable for direct, indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages (including, without limitation, loss of business, revenue, profits, use, data or economic advantage) arising out of or related to the use of the Data and/or the GO Transit API, however caused and whether based on contract, tort (including negligence and strict liability), equity or any other legal theory, and even if Metrolinx has been advised of the possibility thereof. You expressly acknowledge and agree that this limitation shall apply even if the Data and/or the GO Transit API is faulty, incomplete or inaccurate or causes damage to your computer system or the computer system of any third party or end user.</li>
                            <li>11.	<b>Availability of the GO Transit API.</b>Availability of the GO Transit API. You agree that your use of the Data and/or the GO Transit API shall not be made the basis for any claim, suit, demand or other cause of action or other proceeding against Metrolinx, its officers, directors, employees or agents.  You agree, at your expense, to indemnify, defend and hold Metrolinx, its officers, directors, employees and agents harmless against any claim, suit, demand, action, or other proceeding brought or threatened by a third party or end user as a result of (i) your breach of this Agreement; and/or (ii) your use of the Data or the GO Transit API. For greater certainty, the foregoing indemnity shall apply regardless of the form of Data and whether or not it has been segregated, aggregated, combined with other third party information or otherwise modified.</li>
                            <li>12.	<b>Availability of the GO Transit API.</b> While Metrolinx will make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the GO Transit API is available at all times, Metrolinx does not guarantee, represent or warrant that your access to any of the functionality of the GO Transit API will be uninterrupted or error-free. In addition, while Metrolinx makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the GO Transit API is secure, Metrolinx does not guarantee that the GO Transit API will be free from loss, corruption, attack, viruses, “worms”, “trojan horses” or other harmful components, or from interference, hacking or other security intrusions.</li>
                            <li>13.	<b>Cessation of Access.</b> Metrolinx reserves the right to alter and/or no longer provide the GO Transit API at any time without prior written notice.</li>
                            <li>14.	<b>Cancellation for non-compliance.</b>  Metrolinx may suspend or cancel your access to the GO Transit API at any time without notice or any other obligation to you, for any reason, including, without limitation, if: (i) your use of the Data is otherwise unlawful or harmful to others; or (ii) you have breached any term or condition of this Agreement. In the event of such suspension or cancellation, you will no longer be authorized to access, use and download the Data, and Metrolinx may use any means possible to enforce its decision. Any termination of your right to access the GO Transit API shall not relieve you from any liability accruing hereunder prior to the time that such suspension or cancellation becomes effective.</li>
                            <li>15.	<b>General.</b>
                                <ul style="list-style: none;">
                                    <li>a.	This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and all federal laws applicable therein.</li>
                                    <li>b.	Metrolinx reserves the right to change, modify, alter or otherwise update this Agreement, without prior written notice at any time, at Metrolinx’s sole discretion. Your continued access or use of the GO Transit API after the modifications have become effective shall be deemed your conclusive acceptance of the modified terms and conditions.</li>
                                    <li>c.	In your use of the Data, you shall comply with all applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which the Data is being used.</li>
                                    <li>d.	If any term, condition, or provision in this Agreement is found to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, such invalid term, condition or provision will be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.</li>
                                    <li>e.	This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings and negotiations, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.</li>
                                    <li>f.	Metrolinx is not deemed to have waived the exercise of any right that it holds under this Agreement unless such waiver is made in writing. Failure by Metrolinx to exercise any of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder or its delay to do so does not constitute a waiver of those rights, powers or remedies.</li>
